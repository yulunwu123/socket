# Socket Programming in Python
This program creates a  socket server and client. 
The server waits for incoming client connection requests
and accepts connections on the standard loopback interface address. 

In the program, the client sends a message containing an integer through command line input,
 the server receives it, sends back to the client another integer,
and finally, the client prints out the sum of two integers, and both sockets close.
